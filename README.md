# Boring Countdown Clock
A very simple and boring countdown clock made in Python 3 and Tkinter. 

I wrote this while exploring different GUI frameworks for Python 3, and I found that can bbe useful for online classroom, by putting the countdown at the shared screen during the pause I make at the middle of the long class. 

The countdown clock can be called from command line.

Use python3 boring_countdown_clock.py -h for help.

If you install pygame (e.g., pip install pygame) you can have access to a song I embedded in the code and a Robin chirp at the end of the countdown. You can disable the song at any time at the graphical interface or you can launch with option --no_song.
